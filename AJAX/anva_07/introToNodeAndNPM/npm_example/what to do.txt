1) type
	npm install uniq
	node app.js


2) now try instead
	npm init --y
	npm install uniq --save
	node app.js
if you look at the  package.json  created, you will see that it contains the dependency on the  uniq  module.

3) now DELETE the folder node_modules,
and type
	npm install
	node app.js
This time uniq is installed by NPM automatically, because it is listed in  package.json  ;)

4) Finally, try:
	npm test
what happened there?
