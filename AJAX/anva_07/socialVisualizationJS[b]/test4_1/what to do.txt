1.
npm install

... the script will also automatically call 
	npm run build
this is thanks to the "postinstall" script in the package.json file

2. open 
	dist/index_4b.html

3. look inside file 
	dist/main.js
and you will see it is NOT the same file as ./main.js
because Browserify added all the needed libraries into the dist/main.js so only 1 js file is now needed
when downloading the page.
