Let's see how much you remember of javascript and jQuery...
===========================================================

- Look at the files:
	01_generate.html
and
	02_visualize.html

- divide in groups of 2 to 4 people
- each group: 
	- start checking out how my example works
	- define common data format first, to exchange data between the 2 pages
	- then work on the visualize page
	- test often, to see if the 2 pages work together

- every group show result to everybody at the end
