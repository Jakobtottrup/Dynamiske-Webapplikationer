PIG LATIN
=========

1. If starts with consonant (or consonant cluster), then move the end and append "ay"
"pig"    -> "igpay"
"banana" -> "ananabay"
"trash"  -> "ashtray"
"happy"  -> "appyhay"
"glove"  -> "oveglay"

2. If starts with vowel or silent letter, then keep word along and append "way"
"egg"    -> "eggway"
"inbox"  -> "inboxway"
"eight"  -> "eightway"

=========================================================
. First, remember have mocha installed globally (once before at least)
	npm install -g mocha

. Now, type:
	npm test
. then:
	fix the code so the test work
. now, add more tests to check that the piglatin translation works correctly for all the strings 
. run 
	npm test
at each new test that you add, to see that all test so far work
. fix your code more to make it pass the new tests





. Now try to use instead the version 2: pigLatin_v2.js 
which is already implemented, but might smell :)
. test with 
	npm test
. then lint it!
	eslint html/js/pigLatin_v2.js
(in case eslint is not recognizes, try installing it globally
	npm install -g eslint
)
