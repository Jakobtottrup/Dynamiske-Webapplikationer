Keep working on the task from last week
=======================================

- finish implementing the following in the visualization, especially focus on 4.1 and 4.2:
	// 1. read data from localstorage (read all heroes generated previously)
	// 2. create a table (you decide how the table presents the data)
	// 3. loop thru data and write rows in the table
	//    consider creating sub-tables if data has nested data
	// 4.1 when you click on the name of an episode of Star War, the cell of that hero 
	//    should change color (highlighted); 
	// 4.2. Also all cells with a hero who appeared in the same episode should highlight

- add striping (using the code we discussed in this lecture) to make your dynamically created table more readable
