Let's see how much you remember of javascript and jQuery...
===========================================================

- Look at the files:
	01_generate.html
and
	02_visualize.html

- divide in groups of 2 to 4 people
- each group: 
	- start checking out how my example works
	- define common data format first, to exchange data between the 2 pages
	- then work on the visualize page
	- test often, to see if the 2 pages work together

- every group show result to everybody at the end


- for the visualization follow these points:       
	// 1. read data from localstorage (read all heroes generated previously)
	// 2. create a table (you decide how the table presents the data)
	// 3. loop thru data and write rows in the table
	//    consider creating sub-tables if data has nested data
	// 4.1 when you click on the name of an episode of Star War, the cell of that hero 
	//    should change color (highlighted); 
	// 4.2. Also all cells with a hero who appeared in the same episode should highlight
